# CodSoft Projects and Internship Experience

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing projects developed and skills acquired during my internship at CodSoft. This repository includes implementations of various Java-based applications and highlights the experience gained during my time at CodSoft.

## ATM Machine Simulation

This project simulates a basic ATM machine with functionalities including withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. It features a user-friendly command-line interface and interacts with a user’s bank account to perform transactions.

### Features:
- **Withdraw**: Allows users to withdraw money from their account, ensuring sufficient balance.
- **Deposit**: Enables users to deposit money into their account.
- **Check Balance**: Displays the current balance of the user’s account.

### Key Classes:
- `ATM`: Manages user interactions and transaction logic.
- `BankAccount`: Represents the user’s bank account and manages the balance.

## Number Guessing Game

This project implements a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides hints if the guess is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of attempts.

### Features:
- **Guessing**: Users guess a number between 1 and 100.
- **Hints**: Provides hints on whether the guess is too high or too low, and indicates if the guess is very close to the correct number.
- **Attempts Tracking**: Limits the number of attempts and displays the remaining attempts.

### Key Methods:
- `getValidGuess()`: Ensures the user inputs a valid number within the allowed range.
- `provideHint()`: Gives feedback on the user’s guess based on its proximity to the target number.

## Grade Calculation

This project calculates a student’s total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on predefined criteria. It includes input validation to ensure marks are within the acceptable range and calculates grades accordingly.

### Features:
- **Input Marks**: Takes marks for each subject and validates input.
- **Calculate Total Marks**: Computes the sum of marks obtained across all subjects.
- **Calculate Average Percentage**: Calculates the average percentage from the total marks.
- **Grade Assignment**: Assigns a grade based on the average percentage achieved.

### Key Methods:
- `getValidMarks()`: Validates and collects marks for each subject.
- `calculateAveragePercentage()`: Computes the average percentage.
- `assignGrade()`: Determines the grade based on the average percentage.

## Internship Experience at CodSoft

During my internship at CodSoft, I worked on various projects that enhanced my skills and knowledge in Java development. Key aspects of my experience include:

- **Java Development**: Developed applications using Java, focusing on backend services and user interfaces.
- **Project Contributions**: Contributed to projects such as an inventory management system and real-time chat applications.
- **Technical Skills**: Improved proficiency in core Java, object-oriented design, and integrating with databases using JDBC and Hibernate.
- **Team Collaboration**: Worked with cross-functional teams, participated in code reviews, and followed best practices in software development.

This experience was instrumental in advancing my technical skills and understanding of industry practices.
